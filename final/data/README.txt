GlobalLandTemperature Dataset:
This dataset is over 500mb, which I zipped in this folder. If you do not wish to use the zipped folder, you can find it at Kaggle, here (https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data). If you do not have a Kaggle account, you will need to create one (itâ€™s free). Because of the necessary account, I chose to also zip it in this folder.
